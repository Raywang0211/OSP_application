# OSP_application
OSP_application(tomato)
we use the hyperspactral image to apply the OSP 
281*320*256 dimention 
we input the hole data and we want the leaves only,so 'd' assume the leaves' spactral and the other are 'u'
after the OSP we can get a matrix ï¼ŒIn the matrix if the value close to zero we assume 0 otherwise we assume 1
finally we can get leaves only
